        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This flan de coco is a delicious, tropical coconut dessert with flavors of the Caribbean!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups white sugar, divided</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>½ cup fresh shredded coconut</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place 1 cup sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook gently without stirring, but shake occasionally until sugar is melted. Continue cooking until sugar turns golden brown, then pour into a large glass baking dish. Rotate and tilt the dish to spread caramel evenly over the bottom. Set aside for caramel to cool and harden, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add condensed milk, evaporated milk, eggs, milk, coconut, and remaining 1/2 cup sugar to a blender. Blend until smooth, about 3 minutes. Pour over hardened caramel in the baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until custard is set, about 45 minutes. Allow flan to cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Run a knife around the edges of the dish to separate the flan from the sides. Refrigerate until completely chilled, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>To serve, carefully invert flan onto a rimmed serving plate; let caramel sauce flow over flan.</li>
        </ol>
